feh -.

# There are two ways of specifying the theme. Either use feh -Tthemename,
# or use a symbolic link to feh with the name of the theme. eg
# ln -s `which feh` ~/bin/mkindex
# Now when you run 'mkindex', feh will load the config specified for the
# mkindex theme.

# Multiple options can of course be used. If they are too long for one line,
# you can use a \ to make them continue on the next one, but not mid-option.
